- 👋 Hi, I’m Don
- 👀 I’m interested in just about anything that you can thro at me ~
I like Science I read a book from Professor Einstein.when I was in grade school and I've been hooked on Astro Physics
,Quantum Physics and I'm sure Gravity pushes not pulls
But I'm not book smart like most here I pick things up here and there and put it all together and re-arange untill everything fits in it's rightful place> that's how I know if it's true or false
I'm coming OFF of Dissability (I hope) I've been on for about ten years ~ I used to do BODY WORK ,(fix Wrecks) and hurt my back in 1989 just befor christmas
It didn't effect my preformance right away it took about 6 months for me to slowly wind down to a stop I hurt all over and just could not get out of bed anymore
In 1991 I had an Operaqtion on my lower back and I felt great after the Operation but what I didn't know and didn't concider is that Doctors are not trained to fix or cure anything
they are trained to go to what ever you complain about and cut it out or medicate it called treatment. but they don't straighten whats out of line in your back that caused the problem to begin with 
~ So when I went to theropy less than 30 days after my operation and tried to work hard and get back in shape I really messed it up 
I went to so many different theropies I could not count them and I continued to hurt more and more until they started shoving oxycontins and oxicodones down me 
at 4-80 Mg Oxycontins and 3-30 Mg Oxicodones Per day I was just melting away ~ in 2016 I had found a good Doctor and togeter we planned my surgery
The day I came out of surgery WE started cutting back on the pills till I was completely off of them.
It took about 2 years for my pain to subside after that. I had finally noticed that I don't hurt so bad and if I did something to agervate itt
like standing or walking ~ It didn't take too long to feel better~ as befor it never felt better~ But I'd been on my back for so long I had no muscle left
I couldn't see my arms move at all when I supposedly flexed the muscle with in 
I've been on the move ever since trying to get muscle back so I can do something and I'm getting there   cause I'm Here NOW !!!!!!
PLEASE bare with me I'm a little behind but I'm on the way     
Sorry there's no short story  Yet
